# Starbucks Landing Page Clone

- Main purpose of this small project is too practice and demonstrate my pure HTML/CSS skill for creating a landing page.
- Picking a clone concept because I am more focusing on building the page rather than creating new web design.
- Earlier I have read about the BEM CSS Convention which I'll try my best to implement in this web page.
